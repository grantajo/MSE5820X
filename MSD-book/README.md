# MDS-book
This is the main repository for supplementary material (such as Python scripts or figures) for the MDS book 
(Stefan Sandfeld: "Materials Data Science", Springer, 2024, DOI 10.1007/978-3-031-46565-9).

Content:
- The folder `code` contains jupyter notebooks with all code snippets from the book -- sometimes with a few additional examples.

- The folder `python_listings` contains all Python functions and classes that are listed in the "List of Python Listings" at the end of the MDS book. These are functions that are intended for re-use. Everything else can be found in the folder `code`.




## Contributions
I am grateful to the following people for additionally contributing to the repository:
- Sebastien Bompas (s.bompas@fz-juelich.de) created the initial version of the code for the GAN in section 19.5.
- Tarek Iraki (t.iraki@fz-juelich.de) contributed to the deep learning example, section 18.8
- Aytekin Demirci (a.demirci@fz-juelich.de) helped with testing the code, e.g., through teaching ML/DL tutorials at the RWTH Aachen University.
